...open in my browser, that I should go back to:

[[Grand Text Auto|https://grandtextauto.soe.ucsc.edu/]]:

>Ours is a group blog, founded in May 2003, about computer mediated and computer generated works of many forms: interactive fiction, net.art, electronic poetry, interactive drama, hypertext fiction, computer games of all sorts, shared virtual environments, and more. Until May 2009 run as a centralized blog — with authors Andrew Stern, Mary Flanagan, Michael Mateas, Nick Montfort, Noah Wardrip-Fruin, and Scott Rettberg — GTxA is now an aggregator for a distributed group of blogs in which we participate. The authors of these blogs work as both theorists and developers, and are interested in authorship, design, and technology, as well as issues of interaction and reception.
