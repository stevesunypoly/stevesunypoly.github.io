Course description:  In our time, many storytellers have sought to escape the constraints of the beginning-to-end, straight-line narrative. These playful, inventive creator have given us texts that can bbe dizzying and disorienting but also strangely pleasing: short stories told in stream-of-consciousness (Katherine Anne Porter's "The Jilting of Granny Weatherall"), autobiographical essays that follow ABC order (Dinty Moore's "Son of Mr. Green Jeans"), Movies that go backward (Memento). In this course we mill examine several excellent examples of the nonsequential narrative and try our hands at creating some of our own.
