Things to work on in tiddlywiki today:

* Thinking of TW5 as a blog; a tweet as a post. Probably need some concept of a page template for that. I think, modify [[thoughts]] to start...which i did by changing the structure of its name. 

* Importing {{FlickrObject||slider}}'s as DropboxObject's  created with [[IFRecipe]]'s
** (Turns out, I wanted to use the slider macro, which allowed me to find http://tw5magick.tiddlyspot.com/, which is exactly what I needed! I found both the slider macro, and how to create / reference macros in TW5). I don't really like the way this slider macro behaves, but at least I know how to start with it)
* Figuring out what the PaulLeeHTMLDropboxObject is all about

* Test the concept of reading and responding to TW5 hypertextually by exporting .tid files to their dropbox directory
