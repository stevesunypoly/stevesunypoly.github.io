 # At the bottom right of the sharing box, click Advanced.
 # Click Change....
 # Click On - Public on the web > Save.
 # Before closing the sharing box, copy the document ID from the URL in the field below "Link to share." The document ID is made up of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers between slashes in the URL.
# Share the URL that looks like "www.googledrive.com/host/[doc id] where [doc id] is replaced by the document ID you copied. Anyone can now view your webpage.
