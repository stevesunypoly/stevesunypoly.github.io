title: Tiddlywiki tools to investigate
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

From time to time, I'll come across tools that are worth looking at to integrate into our TW framework.

Here are ones I played with today:

http://bjtools.tiddlyspot.com/

Among them on this site:

ClickAction - allows a click to initiate more than one action (in this case, open multiple tiddlers sharing a tag)

Calendar - Creates a clickable calendar for diary and other purposes

http://publicsidebar.tiddlyspot.com/

introduces the idea of a public sidebar, configurable based on url serving the tiddlywiki.
