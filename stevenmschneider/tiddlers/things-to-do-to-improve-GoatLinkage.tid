It is clear to me that the code to be applied to all tiddlers in the set will be stored in a template file. 

for goatNarrative we are using template GoatLinkage (until I rename it :).

Here is what we are needing for both all templates as well as this template:

* all templates
** css styling for entire template
** create better default system for documentation, like ``<<dox everything i put in here is written to the current tiddler field dox, and commented out of the current tiddler as viewed>>``
* specific to this project:
** can we use javascript to create a series of three pulldowns, with the values of each option set through code based on our attributes (using a series of filters?). 
** use js autosubmit so that when a button value is selected it autosubmits and changes the field value as displayed on the tiddler (see [[Widgets Invoking Actions]]) -- might have to be radio buttons, which would be kinda sucky but ok if necessary)
** generate a link to the tiddler as the "go" button. so, two clicks.
