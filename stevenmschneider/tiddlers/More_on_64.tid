Having investigated, briefly, the various types of numbers that 64 is an example of ([[Erd√∏s-Wood|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Woods_number]], [[dodecagonal|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecagonal_number]], [[centered triangular|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centered_triangular_number]] I've concluded that none of those matter -- but given that we want three dimensions, 64 works because "64 is also the first whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube"? Most important: a perfect square, so that the printed/page version of the narrative can be easily represented.
