title: The 2016 Election
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* Folks interested in politics will find any number of topics related to the 2016 campaign. Designing a study that explores one or more of the following could be interesting:
** the app environment that emerges around the election
** digital platforms (twitter, facebook, etc),
**  actors engaging in digital practices  (candidates, citizens, supporters, groups, etc.)
** digital response to events (elections, debates, terrorist attacks, etc)

* Ways of approaching this kind of data include
** App Design & Development - prototype, review or document (for competitive analysis) apps targeting citizens
** Cyberethnography ([[Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-ethnography]]) of the digital electoral landscape.
** Content analysis ([[Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_analysis]]) 
*** of digital platforms like facebook, twitter, using [[If This, Then That]] DIY programming tools to report activities of political actors to google spreadsheets.
*** of digital media like web sites created by political actors (candidates, parties, citizens, etc.)
