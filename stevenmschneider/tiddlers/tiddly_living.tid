''What's really good about TW5'' As I get deeper into TW5, I am more and more impressed . TW5 brings five aspects of hypertextuality -- <<list-links "[tag[Hypertextual Techniques]]">> into sharp relief, and provides opportunities to explore these dimensions as an information designer with even more clarity -- though a bit more code -- than TWC ([[TiddlyWiki Classic|TWC]]). 

''Additional code, like the old sunyit plugins'' It could be that TW5 (for my purposes) needs more macros or plugIns -- such as TagglyTagging -- and a deeper exploration of included macros: <<list-links "[tag[Macros]]">>.

''Tiddlywiki Edition'' Or, move towards creating a [[Tiddlywiki Edition]] -- basically, recoding / reinterpreting and recoding [[SUNYIT tslearning-us.tiddlyspace.com|http://sunyit-tslearning-ui.tiddlyspace.com/]] for TW5. Major barriers: {{Things for teaching - missing in TW5  - present in tiddlyspace||slider}}

''Printing and serving'' From a design perspective, the opportunity to both print and to serve is important. I like the idea of distributing a wiki as a web page, and using it as a blog (basically, like this page), which also provides links to all projects, classes, etc. Important to get that going.

''Static Content'' But it seems like the trick is to have multiple wikis, and it also seems that sharing tiddlers across wikis requires some level of import / export or saving as html / tiddlers. Which could be auto-scripted, probably.
