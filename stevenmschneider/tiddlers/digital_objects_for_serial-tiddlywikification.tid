title: digital objects for serial-tiddlywikification
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

For the Serial-content TiddlyWikification, imagine a set of objects formed by two InflectionPoints -- where inflection points that can be used as bends in the narrativeThe , from larger blocks of content (say, podcast episodes) into smaller chunks of content -- discussions about an issue, person, etc. The objects consist of the material (audio, in this case) that can be heard between two inflection points -- a start time and an end time. 

The object formed by these two points would have fields created on a number of dimensions:

Name/value pairs, with the name the tag, and the value a short descriptive sentence about what happens in the clip to the name / object: (hand-tagged things that would be tagged)

* HaeMinLee : Failed to show up for work at LensCrafters OwensMillsStore at [[Time:199901131800]]
* BoyfriendDon: Received a phone call from LensCrafters OwensMillsStore at [[Time199901131900]] asking if he knew where HaeMinLee was.

So from any one of these 
These name/value pairs would be further accessed by grouping tags, such as:
* People
* Places
* Groups of people / offices / institutions / communities / etc.
* Events
* Days / Times
* Material Source
* Theme
* In

Every 
 or larger block of content
