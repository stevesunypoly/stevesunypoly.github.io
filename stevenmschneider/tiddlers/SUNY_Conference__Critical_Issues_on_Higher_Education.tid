* I've been appointed as a Faculty Fellow to the SUNY Critical Issues in Higher Education. I hope to explore various ways in which faculty can engage in different types of activities -- focused on the  themes of partnerships, affiliations and mergers & acquisitions. In particular, I hope to explore ways in which TiddlyWiki can contribute to these activities through its chunking capabilities.
