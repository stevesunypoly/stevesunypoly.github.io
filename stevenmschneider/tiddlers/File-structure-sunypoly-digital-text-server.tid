Based on projects

Current projects (so three main subdirectories)

* serial-tiddlywiki
* designing-interactive-texts
* sandbox

each project needs identical subfolders:

* images
* tidbox
* tw
* dox
* static

tidbox, images and dox should be writeable by members of the group (which we need to create)

* /tidbox will be used to drop in tiddlers that are to be added to a project tw
* /images will be used to drop in and reference images so that wikis in /tw can call by reference using [img[../images/whatever.jpg]], and perhaps build something so that we can reference external images the way we should  as described at http://tiddlywiki.com/#ExternalImages 
* /dox will be similar to images but contain mp3 files, documents etc that are externalized using _cannonical_URI fields...
* /static will be used to store static html
* /tw will house all tiddlywiki.html files
