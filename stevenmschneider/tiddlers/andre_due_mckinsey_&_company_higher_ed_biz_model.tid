(five students)

# programs at the perifhery will take off and might threaten the academy.  bootcamp, 20 weeks. coding skills. design school. could employers demand specific credentials. this might especialy threaten master's programs. build to order universities reduction in demand for university degrees.
# "real action will take place after graduation as a revolution in life-long learning begins." micro-credentials in management, to programs managed by mckinsey. 2 hours per week. implications: new formats, new credentials, nor portability models. relationships begin with graduation. a 50 year learning relationship.. renew skils every 5 years. 
# "completion, not access, will be the defining issue in higher educaiton." implication: tailored advising and intervention programs. we need to graduate 50% more students for the same amount we spend today
# "competency-based credentialing could unlock trillions of human potential." might we accredit people instead of institutions
# revolution in education finance: no payback until certain income. pay back as tax surcharge on income. scored student loans.
