title: what-is-wrong?
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

just starting to learn TW5, and it is pretty amazing.

But, I must be doing something wrong. [[Name Of A Tiddler]] works, and becomes a link. but [title[Name Of A Tiddler]] does not, and thus, I can't make any more filters!

Why is that?

Thanks to respondents to the [[Google group thread|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tiddlywiki/u9hmarzqba8]]:

Hi Steve,

As Felix says, the latter only makes sense as part of a filter expression, like so - <$list filter="[title[Name Of A Tiddler]]"/>

Adding this will give you a 'list of one' which looks just like a single, inline link.

Regards,
Richard

Or, [[title|Name Of A Tiddler]]
