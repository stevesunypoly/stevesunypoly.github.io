Technique as tools and strategies
* Documentation techniques are ways you go about creating
documentation. The true definition of technique is “a way of carrying
out a particular task, especially the execution or performance of an
artistic work or a scientific procedure”. Technique from a
documentation perspective is the tools and strategies used to create
the documentation.
* The technique defines how you create a document.  It lays out which
tools you will need for creating the document and gives a structure to
how the content will be introduced.
* Technique is very much about the execution of the task. For example,
there are multiple different ways or techniques that people could use
to enjoy pizza. Some examples would be just picking it up and eating
it, folding it, or using a fork and knife (but seriously why?).
* Technique is just the way that someone goes about
doing something, in this case documentation. You can choose either a
static method of documentation or a dynamic method.
* Technique can be defined as describing how you will be doing what
you are doing. If you are performing a written document then how will
you produce it, if you are doing an audio documentation then how will
you be recording it., etc.
* A technique can be described by the tools and strategies that are
used as different strategies and tools used could come across as a new
or different technique.
* Techniques really describe the processes used in making
documentation. For example if your documentation is text based using
some sort of text editor to create it would be a technique used in
creating the documentation. If your documentation had video you would
use some sort of video editor. The techniques you use may vary
depending on whether you want your documentation to be static of
dynamic because the techniques you choose to use will determine what
your production modes are.

Technique
What determines whether the documentation is static or dynamic is the
technique used to make the documentation. Assuming the documentation
is on a web page, Is it made using JavaScript to be interactive and
dynamic? Or is it just a .pdf file posted on a web page? Unless it is
directed to the user based on some attribute of theirs, this would be
considered static.

Suggests that "static" and "dyanamic" are techniques
[[Ezra Neal]]: According to my research, documentation techniques are
ideas that one uses to create proper documentation for a particular
subject.  There are two different methods that are used, dynamic and
static.

Clear writing as a technique
What techniques in can be used in the medium of writing that
facilitate effective documentation production in the mode of text?
Adherence to contemporary and widely accepted definitions of words,
grammar, and spelling are obvious. For instance, using Irish-English
slang with British-English spellings in a document that will be
consumed by American-English speakers will probably result in
unnecessary cognitive demands being placed on the users.

Techniques as a function of the medium
As far as techniques I could be using cross-hatching or glazing or
pointilism or splatter or others. I mentioned those particular
techniques because they can achieve desired effects within the
limitations of the medium that is acrylic painting. So, in this
example the techniques are a function of the limitations of the
medium.  In a similar vein, text-based documentation should be
verbose, highly illustrative and unambiguous because of the
limitations of text: with text we are using abstract symbols (letters)
to represent a process that requires actions of some type to be
manifested in the real world.
