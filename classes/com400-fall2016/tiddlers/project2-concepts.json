Whenever there is work to be emailed in etc,. Professors ask for a .doc/.docx file only, making harder for those who have a Mac without Word on it to submit the required assignment without any trouble.  For my project 2, I will create an end user documentation on how to get a document that was created on a Mac using their programs of Pages, Numbers or Keynote to be accessible to those using Word or any Microsoft program. My project 2 will explain how to do the above without needing to buy Microsoft or use the Online version that is now available. My documentation will assume that the user knows how to access the Mac programs mentioned above and has finished with the assignment and is ready to submit.",

The system I intend on making to deliver this documentation through would be a website similar to ones like stackoverflow or the battle.net forums. In these forums, questions are asked and then answered by either other users, or through member of the development team. The \"answer\" to a question would be the one that receives the most votes in favor of the it. Users will also be allowed to up vote questions to further increase the speed at which they are answered by the staff but are never allowed to down vote a question. This is to try and stop the \"stupid question\" mindset. Once any answer gets a single vote it will not be editable for the user anymore. Users can respond to their own posts to further elaborate on what they meant by an answer or put another response to their first answer as the one that shows up first.",

   "text": "Music has always been a popular entertainment medium throughout the ages but the storage of it has changed greatly. In today's digital age, the methods on how we store music has changed. A majority of us store our music on cloud servers such as Spotify or Google Play Music. For this project I will be providing information on how to upload music that is already stored on a device to Google Play Music. The device(s) that I plan on covering are both laptop (Macbook running macOS Sierra) and mobile (iPhone running iOS 10). People all over have pieces of their music library that's saved on different devices. When time comes to use this music, say at a party or to help them concentrate when they study, it's too much of a hassle to use multiple devices or move all their songs to a single device with no guarantee that their library is going to be there, especially if the device fails. Cloud storage helps to eliminate these inconveniences and make life so much simpler.",

The options initially presented will be tailored to the user's OS. This will be facilitated by browser-sniffing. The page will, by default, display info pertaining to the operating system that the site registers the user as currently using. This method is not fool-proof however due to the fact that the user could be spoofing or obfuscating data, or they may be looking for install docs for an operating system different than the one that they are currently using. Due to these realities I will also provide options to select the subset of the docs that does suit their particular needs.",
