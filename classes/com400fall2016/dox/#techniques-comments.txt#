<<reveal2 "What is static? "
"
* Static documentation makes me think that you do not want to touch it- the same as something that is electronically charged, something that can produce static electricity.  In many ways, you stay clear of something that can shock you and I would assume the same applies with documentation- you do not change or alter it. 
* Static documentation means that the user can only read, but never manipulate the documentation to the point where it is different than when originally loaded. Dynamic documentation means the opposite; manipulatable and interactive.
* Static documentation is always visible in the same form and format, and does not change depending on context, user, or any other situations.
* From my understanding, Static and Dynamic documentation has to do with the viewer and the time. A Static documentation does not change when viewed today or tomorrow 
* As previously stated, documentation that is printed, such as a user’s manual, would be considered static. What you see, is what you get. No changes can be made.
* is something that will not change, it does not depend on who is using it or when. It can be updated, but the updates won’t be automatic like dynamic would be.
* An example would be, documentation printed on paper at a point in time distinct from the need or request for such documentation.

<<reveal2 "Most documentation is static"
"
* With regards to static and dynamic documentation it would seem that most documentation is static. Obviously changes can be made to any documentation to account for updates or changes to software or whatever the documentation is for but none of this is done in real time. So it would seem that the closest we get to dynamic documentation is going from one static document to a new updated static document, but the end result is always static. Unless someone is constantly updating and changing a document, until it is updated that document would be static.

<<reveal2 "How to recognize static documentation"
"
* Anyone comparing static and dynamic documentation that is   inexperienced is going to have a hard time. I feel that to fully understand the difference between the two you have to use both, static and dynamic documentation. During my job over the summer I got the opportunity to be able to work with both types of documentation and i am grateful of it. Static documentation was the more popular form of documentation that was used. Static tends to be more popular because this form is less personal and more broad to the general topic, also static allows the documentation to more abiding. 
* Video and audio wise is more or less static, it is going to be given to you as presented. The most control that you will have over video is being able to pause and start it from a certain point and audio is the same, but you can control the volume in certain applications. The only way for this to be dynamic I feel is if you are the one who is actually editing the clips and images (and sound / music / etc.) that is going into it using an application.
